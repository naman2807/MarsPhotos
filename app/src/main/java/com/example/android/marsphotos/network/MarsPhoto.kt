/**
Sometimes the key names in a JSON response can make confusing Kotlin properties,
or may not match recommended coding styleâ€”for example, in the JSON file the img_src key
uses an underscore, whereas Kotlin convention for properties use upper and lowercase letters ("camel case").

To use variable names in your data class that differ from the key names in the JSON response,
use the @Json annotation. In this example, the name of the variable in the data class is imgSrcUrl.
The variable can be mapped to the JSON attribute img_src using @Json(name = "img_src").
