}
/*
ListAdapter is a subclass of the RecyclerView.Adapter class for presenting List data in a
RecyclerView, including computing diffs between Lists on a background thread.

In this app you will use the DiffUtil implementation in the ListAdapter. The advantage of using
 DiffUtil is every time some item in the RecyclerView is added, removed or changed, the whole list
 doesn't get refreshed. Only the items that have been changed are refreshed.
